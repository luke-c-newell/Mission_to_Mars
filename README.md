# Mission_to_Mars
This repository contains code for a web app that has been created to provide current information on the planet Mars. Using Python, MongoDB, BeautifulSoup, Splinter, HTML/CSS and Jupyter Notebook, I have developed a site that live-updates based on newly scraped data. Please see an image of the site below!
